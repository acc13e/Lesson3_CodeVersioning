            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a way to record and keep track of the changes that are made to a file over time. Rather than having to rename a file multiple times and possibly have hundreds of new files, this method allows for all those changes to be stored in one place. The purpose of this is so that developers can be able to go back and access specific versions of files whenever they need. A VCS is a Version Control System. These are systems that are used to be able to return files back to an original state. This comes in handy for web designers. If a large mistake is made, it then becomes much easier to go back to the state of the project, before the mistake was made, rather than having to start from scratch. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system that is different from others on the market today. Git takes 'snapshots' of your files in order to keep track of the changes. Rather than creating a new file each time, Git is able to take a snapshot of what changes are made to the files. This is the way in which Git keeps track of files. Another service that Git offers is that it only needs local files to work. Rather than having to retrieve the files from a server, Git is able to retrieve the versions of a project from a local disk. Another aspect of Git is that it is impossible to change a file without Git documenting it. This creates integrity and allows for all changes to be recorded.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Git Cycle</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Every file that you have in your repository can be changed and edited and then those changes will be "committed" to the repository. Committing something is a way in which to record the changes that have been made. Once a file is in a state that you want it to stay in for the time being, you commit it. This will take a snapshot of the changes that were made to it. Before a file is commited it is in state called "staged". Once the file is committed the cycle begins again. You can also check the status of your files to see what state they are currently in. </p>
